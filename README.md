# Features
## General

This section discusses the more generic features available throughout the site for all users of the website.

### Navigation Bar
<details>
<summary>Navigation Bar</summary>

![Navbar](readme-docs/screens/navbar.webp)
</details>

The navigation bar is featured across all pages. The navbar is a slightly modified version of the first example from [Bootstrap's navbar documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/navbar/). It includes drop down menus for "Shop", "Help" and "Account", a link to "Recipes" and a cart icon. It also features the website's logo and a search bar.

The logo in the navbar is visible on all sized screens and links to the home page as user's expect so that it is quick and easy to return to the index from any page on the site.

The search bar is featured in the navbar to make it accessible from any page on the site so that a user can quickly search for a product whenever they want, however it is only immediately visible on larger screens. On smaller screens it is available in the collapsible menu through the navbar toggle to reduce clutter on the screen.

The shop drop down menu is available to all users and features links related to products. It includes a link to "Latest Products" and a link for each category of "Seeds", "Sauces", "Seedboxes" and "Sauceboxes". 

The recipes link is available to all users and links to the recipes page. It is just a simple link to a section of the website that is geared towards user engagement. It was decided to give it its own link rather than include it in one of the drop down menus as it has a goal which doesn't quite fit with the other themes, and is important enough that it could be considered a feature that would drive traffic to the website on its own.

The help drop down menu is available to all users and features links related to customer help and support. It includes links to the "FAQ", "Privacy Policy" and "Contact Us" pages.

The account drop down menu is available to all users but the links available is related to the authentication status of the user and whether the user is staff or not when they are logged in. For users who are not logged in, the links in "Login" and "Register". For users who are logged in but who are not staff, the links available include "My Profile" and "Logout". And for users who are logged in and who are staff, the links available are the same as for not staff but also include "Management".

The above links - "Shop", "Recipes", "Help", and "Account" - are visible on larger screens. On smaller screens the navbar collapses and these links are then accessible through the menu toggle.

The cart icon on the far right of the navbar acts as a toggle for the cart offcanvas element. It is a simple icon, which will display the number of items in the cart but otherwise is kept simple and clean.


### Footer
<details>
<summary>Footer</summary>

![Footer](readme-docs/screens/footer.webp)
</details>

The footer is featured across all pages on the website. It includes three simple sections related to customer communication, offering ways for the customer to communicate with the business.

The first section, "Contact Us", includes the address of the business, but then features an inline link to the contact page and encourages the user to visit that page to find all the other ways they can contact the business.

The second section includes the newsletter subscription form. It's a very simple form that only requests the user's email address to sign up.

The third section features social media links for the user to find the business on Facebook and Twitter.


### Index Page
<details>
<summary>Index Page</summary>

![Index](readme-docs/screens/index.webp)
</details>

The index or home page appears the same for all users. It features a carousel at the top of the page, visible to the user immediately upon landing on home page. The carousel currently includes three images. The first is a simple hero image with the business's name. The second is an image that advertises the hot sauce products with a link to the page. And the third is an image advertising the chilli plant seeds with a link to that page. Immediately below the carousel is the website's welcome message for the user.

The next section of the site includes text that briefly introduces the products available to the user on the website. Each short paragraph includes an inline link to the category it is referencing. 

And finally, at the bottom of the index page is a section for the "Newest Products" on the website. This section features four of the products most recently added to the website. They are displayed in "cards" with a thumbnail of the product, a short excerpt of the product's description, its stock status and the product's name as a link to its page.

Overall, the index page is intended to be engaging, informative without overwhelming the customer, and to encourage the user to explore the website further.


### Contact Page
<details>
<summary>Contact Us</summary>

![Contact](readme-docs/screens/contact.webp)
</details>

The contact page is available through a link in the "Help" drop down menu in the navbar and an inline link in the "Contact Us" section of the footer. It is also reachable through other inline links in other pages of the website, for example the review section on product pages includes a sentence with an inline link to this page that encourages users to visit the contact page if they have any concerns as it feels like an appropriate place on the site where user's may wish to reach out to the business.

The contact page is simply laid out. At the top of the page, below the "Contact Us" heading are the contact details for the business. These details include the phone number which allows the user to call the business from their device simply by clicking on it, and the email address which has similar functionality. There is also the full address of the business and the social media links appear here as well.

Below, there is a simple contact form using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for the user to send a message to the business. When submitted, a message is displayed to inform the user that their message has been sent and the business receives the message forwarded in an email by EmailJS.

![Contact Email](readme-docs/screens/contact_email.webp)
<details>
<summary>Contact Email Body</summary>

![Contact Email Body](readme-docs/screens/contact_email_body.webp)
</details>

Finally, there is a google map that indicates where the business is located with a chilli pepper icon.


### FAQ
<details>
<summary>FAQ</summary>

![FAQ](readme-docs/screens/faq.webp)
</details>

Under the "Help" drop down menu in the navbar, there is a link to the FAQ page. This page was created to provide additional context for the user for some areas of the business for which they may have questions or be curious about. While the use of text was intended to be minimal across the majority of the website, occasionally users may wish to learn more about certain aspects of the site or have questions for which the answer is not appropriate to place in other areas of the website. The benefit of having a dedicated section like an FAQ is the ability to expand upon it in the future in case the business discovers there are certain questions they receive frequently from users.

The layout of the FAQ page is extremely simple with an emphasis on legibility. The questions and answers are featured in [Bootstrap Accordion](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/accordion/) elements organised under headings to make the questions on the page easy for the user to sift through to find the ones most relevant to them. When a user finds the question they are looking for, they can simply tap to reveal the answer.


### Privacy Policy
<details>
<summary>Privacy Policy</summary>

![Privacy Policy](readme-docs/screens/privacy_policy.webp)
</details>

Also under the "Help" drop down menu in the navbar is a link to the website's privacy policy. It is a simple privacy policy generated with [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/).


## Products

This section discusses the features related to the products app. 

### Product Card
<details>
<summary>Product Card</summary>

![Product Card](readme-docs/screens/product_card.webp)
</details>

A feature used in "Newest Products", "Latest Products" and on the category pages, a product "card" has a box shadow to contain and highlight the individual product. The card features a simple summary of the products details: the name, a thumbnail image, a short excerpt of the product description, the product's stock status and a link to go to the product page. 

The intention behind displaying products like this in the sections mentioned above was partly inspired by the [Bootstrap Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) element and to limit the information provided for products outside of the product detail page. Only the most essential information needs to be available. The name is obviously important, especialy if it is what the user is searching for. The image is present to draw the user in visually and the excerpt to try to catch the user's attention. The stock information is obviously important as you don't want the user to go to the product page only to find it out of stock, which would be frustrating. And then, of course, the link so the user can access the product page.

Some consideration was put into a "Quick Add" feature for users on the card, but as most products have different variants it was decided to forgo that feature currently.


### Newest Products
<details>
<summary>Newest Products</summary>

![Newest Products](readme-docs/screens/newest_products.webp)
</details>

The most immediate area of the website related to products is the "Newest Products" section on the index page. As described in the "Index Page" feature description above, it displays four of the products most recently added to the website. Its intention is to highlight recently added products, to push them to the front of customers' minds. Users may come to the site with a particular products in mind, but hopefully by advertising newer products on the home page it will encourage users to look at these products as well. For regular users who may be visiting the site for reasons other than an immediate purchase (e.g. browsing, reading recipes) the hope is that they would take a quick look at the "Newest Products" when they visit and find something new they are interested in.

The products are displayed in "Product Cards" which are discussed in the section of the same name above.

### Search Products
<details>
<summary>Search Products</summary>

![Search Products](readme-docs/screens/search.webp)
</details>

The search form in the navbar has basic search functionality. It searches for matches in the product names and description and returns the results displayed as product cards. At the top of the page it informs the user of the number of products found that match the query and includes the query in the result so the user can be sure of what they searched.


### Latest Products
<details>
<summary>Latest Products</summary>

![Latest Products](readme-docs/screens/latest_products.webp)
</details>

Similar to the "Newest Products" section of the index page, the first link under "Shop" is "Latest Products". And like the "Newest Products", this page displays four of the most recently added products, but in each category so a broader range of products may be featured. Again, the intention is to highlight recently added products to give them a boost. While it would be possible to filter individual category pages to display by recently added, and may be necessary in the future if the number of categories were to grow, the latest product page allows the user to simply click a link and view recently added products in all categories on one page. 

The products are displayed in "Product Cards" which are discussed in the section of the same name above.


### Categories
<details>
<summary>Categories</summary>

![Categories](readme-docs/screens/category.webp)
</details>

The category pages are featured on the "Shop" drop down menu on the navbar. There is a link for each category - "Seeds", "Sauces", "Seedboxes" and "Sauceboxes". 

There is a single, simple category template that is used for every category page so that all of these pages have the same layout and are easy to understand for the user. The layout is very simple, the products are displayed in "Product Cards" as described in the section of the same name above, in rows of up to four on larger screens.

There is a simple filter functionality on the category pages which filters the page by subcategory. Almost all products fall within one of "Mild", "Medium", "Hot", and "Mega Hot" subcategories which the user can filter by selecting the subcategory from the drop down menu and clicking "Go".


### Product Detail Page
<details>
<summary>Product Page</summary>

![Product Page](readme-docs/screens/product_page.webp)
</details>

The product detail page has two main sections, the second of which is the product reviews and is discussed in more detail later on in the "Reviews" features.

The first section on this page features all of the products details. The template used for this page is used for all products so that all product detail pages have a similar layout. Similarly, one product model is used for all products with the choice of fields used depending on the type of product. For example, a basic seed product does not require the "ingredients" field to be filled out and, likewise, a hot sauce does not need "growth time". So, the template uses multiple if statements within tables to display a very similar layout for all products to keep a uniform look to the website.

The first part of the product detail page is the section including the product name, the product image and the product description. Then we have the product's details in a table, which includes different information depending on which type of product the user is viewing. This table may include: the product category, heat level, growth time, ingredients, box contents, box in which the product appears, and rating. These details are dependent on factors such as the type of product, whether it has been reviewed, and whether the staff member who entered the product remembered to fill in the field.

The final part of this section of the product detail page is the "Add To Cart" form, which will be discussed in more detail in "Product Variants" and "Cart" features below. Briefly, it allows the user to select which variant of the product they wish to purchase, the quantity, and to add it to their card.


### Product Variants
<details>
<summary>Variants</summary>

![Variants](readme-docs/screens/variants.webp)
</details>

The product's variants are displayed twice on the product detail page. First in the product details table with the heading "Options" and then in the "Select Option" drop down menu in the "Add To Cart" form element. 

The variant model is related to the product model in a one-to-many relationship where each product can have multiple variants for the user to choose from. Where the product model holds the basic information for each product on the site, the related variant model allows for management of options, prices and stock for products. 

When a user selects a variant in the "Add To Cart" form element, the current stock of that variant of the product is then displayed for the user.


### Box Contents
<details>
<summary>Box Contents</summary>

![Box Contents](readme-docs/screens/box_contents.webp)
</details>

"Box contents" is a field in the product model which is used for seedboxes and sauceboxes. It is a many-to-many field related to "self", meaning the product model itself, so that a seedbox contains many seed products, for exmaple.

On a box product page, the products included are shown in the product detail table with the heading "Contents". These are the products the user will receive if they order the box. And then the variants of this box products manages the sizes of the included products and the price of the box, like other products.

If a product is included in a box, when you visit that product's page you will see a line in the table called "Find in" which indicates which box that product is included in. An example of this can be seen in the image above in "Product Variants".


## Cart

This section discusses the features associated with the cart app and the functionality involved with managing the user's cart.

### Add To Cart
<details>
<summary>Product Added</summary>

![Product Added](readme-docs/screens/product_added.webp)
</details>

The "Add To Cart" functionality of the product detail page is one of the most important features of the website, as expected of an e-commerce site. As previously mentioned in the section about "Product Variants", the form element for adding a product to the cart is dependent on the user selecting a variant of the product.

Prior to selecting an option, the "Add To Cart" button is disabled to prevent the user from submitting the form erroneously. This is controlled through a simple event listener in the javascript calling a function that enables/disables the button depending on whether the user has selected the "Select an option" option in the drop down menu. When the user selects a product variant to add to the cart, the button is then activated and the user is able to add the variant they selected to their cart, depending on availability.
```
    const addBtn = document.getElementById("add")  # Where "add" is the button id
    function updateStock() {
        currentStock = stock.textContent
        if (currentStock == "") {
            addBtn.disabled = true
            warning.style.display = "none"
        } else if (currentStock <= 0) {
            quantity.textContent = 0
            warning.style.display = "block"
            addBtn.disabled = true
        } else {
            quantity.textContent = 1
            warning.style.display = "none"
            addBtn.disabled = false
        }        
    }
```
Also, when the user selects a variant in that drop down menu, the "Stock" field in the form element is then filled with the current stock of that variant of the product. The quantity of that variant that the user is able to add to their cart is dependent on the stock available, which is plainly visible to the user. 
<details>
<summary>Add Max To cart</summary>

![Add Max](readme-docs/screens/not_available.webp)
</details>

When a variant is initially in stock and the user then goes to add the maximum available to their cart, the quantity buttons disable when they reach the limit (there is also functionality in place to prevent the user selecting a quantity below 0). At the same time, a message is displayed below the quantity field to alert the user in case they do not realise they have reached the limit and that there are no more available.

<details>
<summary>Not Available</summary>

![Not Available](readme-docs/screens/unavailable.webp)
</details>

If a user selects away from this option after adding to cart and then selects it again or comes across a variant on another product that is not in stock, when they select that variant the stock field displays "0", the select quantity field displays "0", they are unable to change the quantity, the "No more available" message is displayed and the "Add To Cart" functionality is disabled.

The ability to alter functionality of the "Add To Cart" form element based on user selections in vanilla JavaScript is achieved through the use of a MutationObserver as based on code from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)
```
    const config = { childList: true }
    const callback = (mutationList, observer) => {
        for (const mutation of mutationList) {
            if (mutation.type === 'childList') {
                updateStock()
                } else {
                console.log(mutation.type)
            }
        }
    }
    const observer = new MutationObserver(callback)
    observer.observe(stock, config)
```
Stock has been mentioned quite a bit in this section, but for brevity will be discussed later in the "Stock" section of the "Management" features.


### Cart Offcanvas
<details>
<summary>Cart Offcanvas Empty</summary>

![Cart Empty](readme-docs/screens/cart_canvas_empty.webp)
</details>

Based on the [Bootstrap Offcanvas](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/offcanvas/) element, the condensed cart that the user can toggle is designed to have a simple display and limited functionality. 

When the user toggles the cart open, there is a simple heading of "Your Cart" with an "X" next to it to allow the user to close the cart again. Below the heading are two links, one which brings the user to the full cart page and another that goes directly to the checkout.

When the cart is empty, the link to go to the full cart page will bring the user to that page, but the "Go To Checkout" link redirects the user to the index page with a message of "There's nothing in your cart at the moment." Also, when the user's cart is empty the body of this element simply states "Your cart is empty."

<details>
<summary>Cart Offcanvas With Item</summary>

![Cart Full](readme-docs/screens/cart_canvas.webp)
</details>

When the user has items in their cart, the cart offcanvas element displays a small box related to user's cart total and delivery immediately below the links. This box displays the total in the cart in a large font and below that information regarding the delivery costs (or if there is no delivery cost applicable as the user has reached the threshold).

Following the total and delivery costs, is a short message to the user to alert them that there is a time limit for checkout. The user is given two hours from when they last added an item to their cart during which the items will be held for them, but after which their cart will be emptied and the items will be restocked. This will be discussed further in the "Stock" section of the "Management" features. 

Below this, short summaries of the items in the cart are displayed. The information includes the thumbnail, name of the product, size select and quantity. Below the list of items is the button to clear the cart.

Within this cart offcanvas element there are no options to adjust the quantity of the items within the cart or to remove individual items. It was decided to leave this functionality to the full cart page to reduce clutter in this element as it is intended as brief summary of the most important elements of the user's impending order. The only CRUD functionality available on this element is the "Clear Cart" button due to the simplicity of it.


### Cart
<details>
<summary>Cart</summary>

![Cart](readme-docs/screens/cart.webp)
</details>

The cart page features a summary on the left hand side or top of the page depending on the size of the user's device. On the right hand side or below the summary is a more details list of the items in the user's cart.

The cart summary is a simple table with rows displaying the details of the user's order. It starts with the total number of items in the cart. Then there is a list of each item with their name, quantity, size and price. This is followed by the total if the item prices, the delivery cost and the grand total. Below the table a message is displayed alerting the user to how much more they have to spend to get free delivery, unless they have already reached this. Under this are the "Clear Cart" and "Checkout" buttons.

The item list is on the right of the page on larger screens or below the summary on smaller screens. Here, the user is able to adjust the quantity of the items in the cart or remove the item entirely.


### Adjust Cart
<details>
<summary>Adjust Cart</summary>

![Adjust Cart](readme-docs/screens/adjust_cart.webp)
</details>

For each item on the cart page there is the ability to adjust the quantity of the item in the cart. This required slightly different code than was used for the "Add To Cart" form element as here the variant is already selected, but the idea is still the same where the user has to be prevented from adding a quantity greater than the actually number in stock. When the user adjusts the quantity and clicks "Update" they can see that the number has changed, but there is also a small confirmation message that appears to provide additional feedback.

Again for brevity and to try to keep features and concepts contained, the stock feature will be discussed further in "Management" features.


### Remove From Cart
<details>
<summary>Remove From Cart</summary>

![Remove Cart](readme-docs/screens/remove_cart.webp)
</details>

Along with adjusting the quantity of items in the cart, the cart also has a "Remove" feature for each item present in the cart. This is a very simple function that deletes the item from the cart and gives the user a confirmation message. When the item is removed from the user's cart it is restocked and they can add it to their cart again if they change their mind.


### Clear Cart
<details>
<summary>Clear Cart</summary>

![Clear Cart](readme-docs/screens/clear_cart.webp)
</details>

The clear cart feature is an expansion on the "Remove" function. More extreme, the user is able to empty their entire cart and begin again with their shopping if they choose. They receive a short message stating that their cart is cleared. The items that were in their cart are then restocked.

## Purchasing

This section discusses the features related to the checkout app and the functionality involved with user purchases on the site.

### Checkout
<details>
<summary>Checkout Empty Form</summary>

![Checkout](readme-docs/screens/checkout_empty.webp)
</details>

To reach the checkout page, the user can click on the link in the cart offcanvas element or on the "Checkout" button below the summary table on the cart page.

The checkout page has two sections. To the left or on top, depending on the size of the user's device, is the summary of the order. Similarly to the cart page, this summary is a simple table listing the most relevant details of the items in the order. It includes small thumbnails of the items as well as the name just to be clear to the user what they are purchasing. Below this is the delivery cost and grand total.

On the right of or below the order summary, is the form for delivery details. It appears slightly differently depending on whether the user is logged in or not, and whether their details are already saved. For a guest user the form will appear blank. If the user is logged in but has not saved their details previously, the email field will be prepopulated and at the bottom of the form is an option to save their details to their profile.

<details>
<summary>Checkout Filled Form</summary>

![Checkout Filled](readme-docs/screens/checkout_filled.webp)
</details>

If the user has previously had their details saved to their profile, these details will be prepopulated in the form fields when the user loads the checkout page. Any changes the user makes to their details in the form can be saved by selecting the save option when they submit the form

Directly below the delivery details is the [Stripe](https://stripe.com) card element where the user inputs their card details to complete the order.

Before the submit button, there is a warning to the user stating how much money their card is about to be charged.

For the delivery form and Stripe elements, the code is based on Code Institute's [Boutique Ado](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1) project.


### Complete Order
<details>
<summary>Checkout Success</summary>

![Checkout Success](readme-docs/screens/checkout_success.webp)
</details>

When the user completes their order successfully, they are brought to the checkout success page which summarises the details of their order and their delivery details.
A success message is displayed on the top of the page which notifies the user of their order number and that a confirmation email will be sent to the email they provided on the delivery form.

Just below the "We have your order" message at the top of the page, there is a link for the user to download a PDF copy of their order so that they can print a simple hardcopy.


### Order Confirmation
![Order Confirmation Subject](readme-docs/screens/order_confirm_email_line.webp)
<details>
<summary>Order Confirmation Email</summary>

![Order Email](readme-docs/screens/order_confirm_email_body.webp)
</details>

Using Stripe webhooks based on the Code Institute [Boutique Ado](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1) project, when a user submits their order a confirmation email is then sent to the user with their payment and delivery details.


### Order PDF

The PDF of the user's order is created using [Reportlab](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/outputting-pdf/). It generates a very simple summary of the user's order, not unlike the confirmation email, except that the items the user ordered are also listed in the summary. The intention is to provide a convenient method for the user to download or print a copy of all the relevant details of their order.


## User Authentication and Profiles

This section discusses features related to the user authentication, and user profiles and reviews in the profiles app.

### Registration
<details>
<summary>Register</summary>

![Register](readme-docs/screens/register.webp)
</details>

[Django allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) was used for user authentication for this website and so functionality for registration and authentication is handled by allauth. The templates used for registration, login/logout, and email confirmation are allauth templates which have been styled to match the rest of the website.

Registration is accessed through the "Register" link under the "Account" drop down menu and is unnecessary for most functionality on the website. A user can complete a purchase and generate a successful order without registering. Most functionality that requires registration is secondary to the purpose of the site and related to customer engagement and retention.

Above is the registration form. Once successfully completed, the user is redirected to the page in the image below where they are informed that a verification has been sent to their email address.

<details>
<summary>Verification Sent</summary>

![Verification Sent](readme-docs/screens/verify_sent.webp)
</details>

![Verification Inbox](readme-docs/screens/verify_email_inbox.webp)
<details>
<summary>Verification Email</summary>

![Verification Email](readme-docs/screens/verify_email.webp)
</details>

Following the link in the email above, the user is brought to the confirmation page where they can confirm their email address and then are able to login to their profile. When a user successful registers with the site and logs in for the first time, a user profile is created for them in a one-to-one relationship.

<details>
<summary>Confirm Email</summary>

![Confirm Email](readme-docs/screens/confirm_email.webp)
</details>
<details>
<summary>Email Confirmed</summary>

![Login Confirmed](readme-docs/screens/login_confirmed.webp)
</details>


### Login
<details>
<summary>Login</summary>

![Login](readme-docs/screens/login.webp)
</details>

The login page is accessed through a "Login" link under the "Account" drop down menu and the template is standard from allauth and accepts either the user's username or email and their password as valid credentials to login. 

Upon logging in, the user is redirected to their user profile.


### Logout
<details>
<summary>Logout</summary>

![Logout](readme-docs/screens/logout.webp)
</details>

When a user is logged in, the log out page is accessed through a "Logout" link under the "Account" drop down menu. Again, this is a standard allauth template styled to match the rest of the website.


### User Profile
<details>
<summary>User Profile</summary>

![Profile](readme-docs/screens/user_profile.webp)
</details>

User profiles are created automatically when a user registers with the website, as based off of the code from Code Institute's [Boutique Ado](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1) project. When a user logs in, they are redirected to their profile.

The main page of the user profile includes a section for the user's details and a table of their order history. Above the user's details, there are options available for the user to edit their profile details and to delete their account.

The order history table summarises their orders with their order number, the date it was placed, the total and a link to the checkout success page for that order so that they can review it in more detail there.

There are two links below the "Your Profile" heading at the top of the page. One link brings the user to the page containing their reviews and the other links to the page where they can manage their submitted recipes.


### Your Reviews
<details>
<summary>User Reviews</summary>

![User Reviews](readme-docs/screens/user_reviews.webp)
</details>

"Your Reviews" on a user's profile is a page which contains a list of the reviews that the user has left on products. A user can leave a review anonymously, but there are certain features related to reviews which require a user to be logged in. One of these is the ability to access this history of their reviews.

This page displays each review with all relevant details. It states which product the review is for and links to that product page. It states the date of the review, the body of the review and the rating which the user left. There are also options to edit or delete the review. The user can also edit or delete their reviews directly in the review section of the product's detail page. This functionality is only available to registered users.


### Your Recipes
<details>
<summary>User Recipes</summary>

![User Recipes](readme-docs/screens/user_recipes.webp)
</details>

On the "Your Recipes" page the user is able to submit a recipe for the website to consider for publication and view a list of the recipes that they have submitted already.

User submitted recipes are not published directly by the website. User's are given a simple form with which to submit the recipe, but if the website chooses to publish the submitted recipe they will do so through their own recipe page in the "Management" section. This area in the user profile provides a way for user's to suggest recipes to the site to encourage engagement.

If the website chooses to use a submitted recipe, they will mark it as published and a message will appear on this page next to the recipe. 

In future this area of the user profile could be expanded to include a section where the user can save their favourite recipes from the website.


### Product Reviews
<details>
<summary>No Product Reviews</summary>

![No Reviews](readme-docs/screens/review_none.webp)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Product Review</summary>

![Review](readme-docs/screens/approved_review.webp)
</details>

The product detail page features a review form which user's can complete to submit a review and rating for a product. The user does not need to be registered to do so, but if they are not they cannot edit or delete their reviews after they have been published.

When a user submits a review, a message is displayed thanking the user for submitting the review but it is not displayed immediately. Reviews require moderation and have to be approved from the "Management" section of the website. Once approved, the review will be displayed on the product page.

If a user is logged in when looking at their own review on the product page, the options for edit and delete are present on the review they submitted. For an admin user, the option to delete a review is always present on all reviews.


### Product Ratings
![Rating](readme-docs/screens/rating.webp)

On each review that is submitted for a product, the individual rating that a user submitted is displayed. The average for all of these submitted ratings is then taken and displayed on the product's detail table.


## Recipes

This section discusses features related to the recipes app.

### Recipes
<details>
<summary>Recipe List</summary>

![Recipe List](readme-docs/screens/recipe_list.webp)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Recipe Page</summary>

![Recipe](readme-docs/screens/recipe.webp)
</details>

Recipes are added to the site by staff through the "Management" dashboard. 

The website's recipe section is accessed through the "Recipes" link in the navbar and is available to all site users. This link brings the user to the list of recipes which displays a summary of each recipe. The recipe title on the summary links to the recipe page. And the date the recipe was created and the excerpt for the recipe are displayed beneath it.

The recipes are laid out quite simply on the recipe page. Optionally, the staff member who added the recipe may choose to add an image which will be displayed next to the introductory paragraph. Otherwise the recipe page layout follows a simple flow of title, introduction, ingredients, directions and, optionally, an outro to wrap up if necessary.

The recipes section is a very simple, blog-like addition to the website to drive user engagement and encourage users to revisit the site in between purchases.


### Recipe Comments
<details>
<summary>Recipe Comments</summary>

![Recipe Comments](readme-docs/screens/recipe_comments.webp)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Recipe Commented</summary>

![Recipe Commented](readme-docs/screens/recipe_commented.webp)
</details>

The main way for users to interact with the recipes is by commenting. Commenting functionality is very similar to recipe reviews. Each recipe page features a comment form that users can complete and submit, the comment is then moderated, and when approved the comment is then displayed on the recipe's page.

Again, like the product reviews, the user does not need to be registered to submit a comment but only registered users can edit or delete their own comments.


## Management

This section discusses features related to the management app. A lot of the features discussed here relate to other apps in the project where their functionality is accessed through the management app by staff.

The management section or dashboard of the website is only accessible to site user who are staff. This section of the website contains functionality related to product and recipe management and user moderation. Similar functionality is available to admin users through the admin panel, however this management dashboard allows staff to perform basic management tasks without having to leave the main website.

To prevent non-staff users from accessing the management dashboard the link only appears in the "Account" drop down menu for user's who are staff, and there is a simple mixin - the StaffRequiredMixin - that leverages Django's LoginRequiredMixin and UserPassesTestMixin for the management views in case users try to manually enter the url.
```
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin


class StaffRequiredMixin(LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin):
    def test_func(self):
        return self.request.user.is_staff
```

### Products
<details>
<summary>Management Products</summary>

![Management Products](readme-docs/screens/management_products.webp)
</details>

The product dashboard is the first page that the staff user will arrive on when they access the management. Immediately at the top of the page, below the "Products" heading is a button to "Add New Product" which allows the user to add new products to the website.

The bulk of this dashboard are tables of the products on the website. These tables are best displayed on large screens, but do function on small devices. However there is a disclaimer on smaller screens that warns that the page is better suited to large screens.

These product tables are grouped by category and then subcategory. For example, within the Seeds category, you will find a table for Mild Seeds which will include all the seeds whose subcategory is mild. The number of products within each category and subcategory is visible for the user.

Within each table, there is minimal information for the product as the focus is on functionality. A typical product entry will include a name which links to the product's page, whether the thumbnail is present or not (as this also tells us if the product has an image unless something has gone wrong), then options to "Edit" the product, "Delete" the product, "Add" a variant, and view the variants.

If no variants are present, this is indicated on the table when the product's variants are toggled to visible. Variants can be added by clicking "Add" under the variant heading for a product. When variants are present their details include the "Size", "Price", and "Stock", and options to "Update Stock", "Edit" and "Delete" the variant.

From this table, the user is able to perform basic CRUD functions for the products and variants on the website, which is the aim of this section of the website. However, for each product on the website the options to "Edit" and "Delete" are also available on other pages for staff members. For example, if a user is a logged in as staff when they view the product detail page, below the description there are options to "Edit" and "Delete" the product. These options, particularly to edit, are available here in case the staff member is viewing the product page and notices a simple error like a typo and so does not need to return to the management dashboard to correct this.


### Stock
<details>
<summary>Management Stock</summary>

![Management Stock](readme-docs/screens/management_stock.webp)
</details>

On the products page of the management dashboard, staff users can adjust the stock for variants by clicking "Update Stock" in the table. This opens a modal with a single field for the user to enter the stock. They can then see the new stock under the "Stock" heading in the table.

This variant stock can be managed here in the management dashboard by manually altering the stock field, but throughout the rest of the website stock is mainly managed by models and functions in the cart app. When a user adds a product to their cart, the item is also added to the HeldCart and HeldItems model in a similar way to the cart in their session. The quantity of the item is also added and the quantity of stock available for purchase is then reduced by this amount.

There is a time limit for how long users can hold items in their cart. This is to prevent stock from being added to a cart, reducing the amount of available stock for other users, then abandoning their cart and having the stock disappear from the database. How this is prevented is that user's have a two hour window to checkout from the time they last added an item to their cart. When the user reaches the end of this two hour window without checking out, the items are removed from their cart and restocked.

The held cart objects are tied to the user's session cart via the session key. This tethers the held cart object to the session cart without having the user needing to have an account and prevents duplicate carts. If a user is to log in or out, the session key is changed and the held cart is then left to count down to restock the items. A warning is displayed on product pages by the "Add To Cart" button advising users to login before they start shopping.

Restocking abandoned carts is handled by functionality implemented through [APScheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/). Within the cart app, there is a simple restock job that checks the cart's time and if it has reached the limit will restock items and delete the held cart.
```
def restock():
    carts = HeldCart.objects.all()

    if carts is not None:
        for cart in carts:
            if cart.check_time():
                for held_item in cart.held_items.all():
                    variant = Variant.objects.get(id=held_item.variant.id)
                    variant.current_stock += held_item.qty
                    held_item.delete()
                if not cart.held_items.exists():
                    cart.delete()
```
Scheduling of this task is handled within updater.py and runs this function every 15 minutes when the app is running.
```
from datetime import datetime
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
from .job import restock


def start():
    scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()
    scheduler.add_job(restock, 'interval', minutes=15)
    scheduler.start()
```
The implementation of APScheduler for handling this job is based on a tutorial from [Did Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzy4G1wZ7NQ&ab_channel=DidCoding).


### Reviews
<details>
<summary>Management Reviews</summary>

![Management Reviews](readme-docs/screens/management_reviews.webp)
</details>

In the management dashboard, there are links available at the top of the page to navigate to different pages within the dashboard. One of these navigates to "Reviews" which lists the user reviews.

User reviews are displayed as a list. Each review displays the name of the reviewer (or anonymous), the date of the submitted review, the products reviewed, the rating and the content. Options are available for each review to "Delete" the review or approve it. Once a review has been approved, this status is then displayed.

In the future, it may be beneficial to introduce further classifications for user reviews beyond a boolean of approved or not. Possibly classifications could include "Pending Approval", "Not Approved", and "Approve". However, currently with the option to delete reviews, reviews that are not acceptable can be removed in that way.


### Recipes
<details>
<summary>Management Recipes</summary>

![Management Recipes](readme-docs/screens/management_recipe.webp)
</details>

The recipes section of the management dashboard also includes the submitted recipes and the recipe comments. At the top of the page, beneath the links, is the button to "Add Recipe" which brings the user to the recipe form for submitting recipes to the site. 

The recipes page itself is a list of recipes displayed as a summary. It displays the title linking to the recipe page, the date created, the excerpt from the recipe, and options to "Publish", "Edit" and "Delete" the recipes. When the recipe is published on the website, this option to publish is replaced with a message stating that it has been publish and displays the link to the recipe page.

Staff users can also edit and delete recipes directly from the recipe pages. These options are displayed for users who are logged in and who are staff.


### Submitted Recipes
<details>
<summary>Submitted Recipe</summary>

![Submitted Recipes](readme-docs/screens/user_recipe_approve.webp)
</details>

Within the recipes section of the management dashboard, there is a link to the "Submitted Recipes" page which displays the recipes submitted by users. From this page, the staff users are able to review the submitted recipes and if they are chosen to publish on the website, they can mark them as "Published" to provide feedback to the owner.

The intention is not to directly publish the recipe. From this point, the staff user is expected to add the recipe to the site via the normal route while crediting the original user.


### Comments
<details>
<summary>Management Comment</summary>

![Management Comment](readme-docs/screens/management_comments.webp)
</details>

Also within the recipes section of the management dashboard, is a link to the "Recipe Comments" to allow staff users to manage comments on recipe pages.

In the same way that user reviews are displayed, the user comments display the user who commented, the date it was added, the comment body and options to "Delete" or "Approve" the comment. This section allows for moderation of comments on the recipes as comments are not displayed until approved by a staff member.


## Admin

Most of the functionality available on the main website to staff users is also available through the admin panel. Most models are registered to allow admin users to perform CRUD functionality through the admin panel.

In some cases CRUD functionality is only available through the admin panel. For example, categories are registered with admin but there's no functionality available through the management dashboard on the main site. It was decided that because any addition to categories also may require changes to templates (e.g. navigation links, the latest products template), that it would beyond the scope of an average staff member to make any additions to categories and so this functionality should remain within admin where it can be accessed by an IT person.

Similarly, users and user profiles can be managed through the admin panel, including changing passwords and deleting users, but this functionality is not present on the management dashboard to discourage staff from attempting to manipulate the user database. Users are able to edit their own profile details or delete their account themselves, but these options are available to them through their profile as they have the right to manage their own personal information.


## Future Features

1. __Improved Stock Management__:
  - Stock management can be improved to allow users more control over their cart. Users could be allowed to keep their carts when logging, or, when logged in, be allowed to save their cart for a period of time.
2. __Order Again__:
  - For registered users you could offer an "Order Again" button for items in their order history. This could be as simple as clicking the button and adding the item to their cart like on a product page, with the function only having to check whether it is in stock or not.
3. __Improved Category Filtering__: 
  - Expanding category filtering beyond subcategory could include filtering by average user rating or popularity, if we were to expand the product model to track the number sold.
4. __Plant Care Blog__:
  - As part of marketing and providing content to users, a plant care blog may could expand the site further beyond products, giving users another reason to return to the site between purchases.
5. __Expanded Product Range__:
  - Providing products beyond seeds and sauces. Expanding the range to include items related to plant care or cooking could draw more users, and repeat users. This may require altering the current product models.

# Design

## Colour

The colour palette used for the website based on the central red which was colour picked from the main image used on the carousel on the index page. From there, colours were chosen to compliment or contrast, selecting for legibility, simplicity and to stay with the chilli pepper theme.

## Mockups

Initially, the project idea came about during planning for a previous project and mockups were created then. At that stage the project was put aside in favour of another idea that better fit the requirements. At the time, the project was proposed as a subscription box service. It has since changed but the design of the website still shares some similarities visually with the intial mockups.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created in Balsamiq. They were used for initial planning for the layout of the website.

</details>

Keyword research was performed using [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/search), which can be seen in the images linked above.

The final keywords used on the website were "chilli seeds, chilli plant, chilli growing, growing chillies, growing chilli seedsn, chilli pepper plant, chilli recipes, homemade hot sauce, hot sauce Ireland".


## Marketing
Based on Code Institute's Web Marketing, questions were collected to try to decide on marketing for the website.

- What kind of business is it?
  - B2C
- Who are your customers?
  - Customers looking for locally made hot sauce or to grow plants to make their own
- Which online platforms would you find lots of your users?
  - Facebook, Twitter, possibly Instagram for the visual nature of the plants, maybe YouTube for cooking videos, also possibly Reddit for gardening tips, especially indoor
- What do your users need? How could you deliver useful content to them?
  - Hot sauce and chilli seeds. Useful content could include reviews and recommendations for both (currently user generated by reviews and ratings on the site), updates to social media/newsletter when new products are on sale, and recipes and plant care articles on the website and through a newsletter.
- Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?
  - Sales and discounts could be offered. Either through posting alerts for sales on social media or sending discount codes to people on the newsletter.
- Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?
  - Possibly a small budget. Hot sauce is popular but still a little niche in Ireland. Perhaps it would start with low cost options like social media and newsletters.

The e-commerce businesses that inspired aspects of this website include:
  - [Fatalii Seeds](https://fataliiseeds.net/)
  - [Chilli Pepper Madness](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/)


## Content Marketing

The Recipes app was added to the project in an effort to create additional content on the website aimed at customer engagement and retention. 

By publishing recipes related to the products on the website, this part of the project aims to encourage customers to return to the website other than for purchases (and they may decide to browse products, especially those mentioned in recipes, during their visit). Similarly to the reviews feature on the product pages, recipes have a comment section to allow for customer engagement and interaction. Engagement could be expanded to include links so users can search by most popular recipes. And "favouriting" recipes so that users can compile recipes they want to easily find.

The Recipes app also includes functionality for customers who are registered to submit recipes from their user profile as a way to encourage customers to engage with the website.

A possible expansion on using content for marketing beyond want is in place currently, could include other engaging features which are easily implemented, such as a plant care blog to encourage customers to return to the site for tips on growing and caring for their chilli plants.

Both the Recipes app and the Blog ideas require considerable content creation from the business owner though which may be time consuming. So, another possible idea that was considered was a "Plant Care Forum" where the content can be user generated and would require users to be registered with the site which may encourage user retention. The drawback to this is it would require more constant moderation as users expect their messages to appear in a forum with little delay and so a moderator would need to check regularly to ensure inappropriate messages are removed.


## Social Media
<details>
<summary>Facebook Mockup</summary>

![Facebook](readme-docs/mockups/facebook.webp)
</details>

Above is a mock up of the Facebook business page for the Chillibox. This would be the primary social media site for the business to communicate with customers. Twitter would also be a good choice, especially for quick alerts for sales, etc.

Instagram and YouTube should be consider with site expansion as chilli pepper plants are visually appealing and the Recipes app could be expanded to include videos or links to videos of the recipes being prepared for the website.


## Email

Through a subscription form in the footer, the website implements newsletter using Mailchimp. The intention with the newsletter would be to update customers when new products are added to the site and new recipes are published, or to send discount codes to newsletter subscribers which is a common practice

# Testing

Testing for the site can be found at the below link:

[Link to TESTING.md](TESTING.md)


# Deployment

## Steps to deploy site using Heroku:
- Assuming gunicorn, dj_database_url, psycopg2 and django-cloudinary-storage have been installed
- Create an external database with ElephantSQL
  - Register/login to your ElephantSQL dashboard and click "Create New Instance"
  - Select a name and plan for your database
  - Then click "Select Region"
  - Select a region and data center close to you
  - Click "Review", then check your details are correct and click "Create Instance"
  - Select the database from your dashboard and you can see the URL for your database
- On the Heroku dashboard, select "New" and click "Create new app"
  - Create a unique app name - this will be added to allowed hosts in the project settings
  - Select your region
  - Click "Create app"
- Go to the Resources tab:
  - Search for "postgres" in the add-ons search bar and select "Heroku Postgres"
  - Click "Submit Order Form"
- Go to the settings tab:
  - Scroll down to the config vars section and select "Reveal Config Vars"
  - Add a new config var for DATABASE_URL - copy the URL from your ElephantSQL database that you created earlier
  - Add a new config var for SECRET_KEY - create your own or use a django secret key generator
  - Add a new config var for CLOUDINARY_URL - copy the "API Environment variable" from your cloudinary dashboard, do not include "CLOUDINARY_URL="
  - Add a new config var for STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY - copy your public key from stripe
  - Add a new config var for STRIPE_SECRET_KEY - copy your secret key from stripe
  - Add a new config var for STRIPE_WH_SECRET - copy your webhook secret from stripe from when you connected your endpoint
  - Add a new config var for EMAIL_HOST_USER - enter the gmail address you're using for this project
  - Add a new config var for EMAIL_HOST_PASS - enter the 16 digit key gmail app password
  - Add a new config var for DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC, with the value 1 - this will be removed before deployment
- In your project, for your environment variables:
  - Create a new env.py file in the top level directory
  - In env.py:
    - Import os
    - Add 'os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste the DATABASE_URL from the Heroku app here"'
    - Add 'os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Paste your new secret key here"'
    - Add 'os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "Paste your CLOUDINARY_URL as in the Heroku app here"'
    - Add 'os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "Paste your STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY here"' - this isn't required to be secret, but for sake of keeping these keys together
    - Add 'os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "Paste your STRIPE_SECRET_KEY here"'
    - Add 'os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "Paste your STRIPE_WH_SECRET here"'
  ```
  import os

  os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'postgres://exampledatabaseurl'
  os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'examplesecretkey'
  os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'cloudinary://examplecloudinaryurl'
  os.environ['STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY'] = 'examplestripepublickey'
  os.environ['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'] = 'examplestripesecretkey'
  os.environ['STRIPE_WH_SECRET'] = 'examplestripeWHsecret'
  ```
  - If not already present, create a .gitignore file and add env.py to it

- In your project, in settings.py:
  - Import os
  - Import dj_database_url
  - if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
	import env
  ```
  import os
  import dj_database_url
  if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
      import env
  ```
  - Replace the insecure secret key with "SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')"
  ```
  SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
  ```
  - Link new database by commenting out old DATABASES section and adding:
	DATABASES = {
			'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
			}
  ```
  DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
  ```
  - Add Heroku to the allowed hosts: "ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['the_app_name_from_heroku.herokuapp.com']
  ```
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example-heroku-app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
  ```
  - Add 'cloudinary_storage' (above 'django.contrib.staticfiles') and 'cloudinary' (below) to INSTALLED_APPS
  ```
  ...
  'cloudinary_storage',
  'django.contrib.staticfiles',
  'cloudinary',
  ...
  ```
  - Setup Cloudinary to store static and media files
  ```
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
	STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
	STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
	STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

	MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
	DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
  ```
  - Run 'python3 manage.py collectstatic' to collect static files
- In your project:
  - Create a Procfile in the top level directory and add 'web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi' to tell 
  ```
  web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi
  ```
  - Create a requirements file with 'pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt' for Heroku to install required packages
  ```
  pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
  ```
  - Make migrations with 'python3 manage.py migrate'
  ```
  python3 manage.py migrate

## Acknowledgement
- Iuliia Konovalova - My mentor Julia was very supportive during this project. She certainly pushed me to complete a high standard of project especially for the readme and testing sections. I took inspiration from her README.md and TESTING.md files for my own.
- Happiness Generator - My first hackathon project. I learned so much from participating in this project and team. We won the March hackathon for 2024 and my team members were a great source of inspiration for me.
- freeCodeCamp - I completed the freeCodeCamp responsive web design module before enrolling in code institute and I learned much from that module that I was able to utilise for this project.
- CodeInstitute - The learning material produced by code institute has been very high quality and I have learned a lot from it. 
Boutique Ado - The Boutique Ado app has heavily influnced this project. As it was only the second django project I had seen before and with the complexity of producing a django project for the second time I had to heavily lean on the existing project. A lot of the Doggo Down Under website is taken from the boutique Ado project but I have made enough changes to it to create a unique standalone project.
